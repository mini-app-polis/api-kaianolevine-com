# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Authentication
#
# CURRENT: Simple header-based auth using X-Owner-Id or KAIANO_API_OWNER_ID fallback.
# No real security — intended for internal processor-to-API calls only.
#
# FUTURE (when deejaytools.com or another frontend has real user accounts):
# Replace with Clerk JWT verification. The scaffolding for this is already
# planned:
#
#   1. Set CLERK_AUTH_ENABLED=true in Railway
#   2. Set CLERK_JWKS_URL to your Clerk app's JWKS endpoint
#   3. Replace get_current_owner below with JWKS-based JWT verification
#      using PyJWT[crypto] — verify RS256 tokens, extract `sub` as owner
#   4. Update KaianoApiClient in kaiano-common-utils to use Clerk M2M tokens
#      instead of X-Owner-Id (use a JWT Template in the Clerk dashboard +
#      Clerk Backend SDK to issue short-lived tokens, cached until expiry)
#
# See: https://clerk.com/docs/backend-requests/making/jwt-templates
#
# PROJECT KEYSTONE — transition sequence:
#
#   Phase 1 (now):     legacy=TRUE,  clerk=FALSE  → X-Owner-Id only (current)
#   Phase 2 (cutover): legacy=TRUE,  clerk=TRUE   → both accepted; migrate cogs
#   Phase 3 (cleanup): legacy=FALSE, clerk=TRUE   → Clerk JWT only
#
# Flags:
#   flags.keystone.legacy_auth_enabled  — checked before falling back to X-Owner-Id
#   flags.keystone.clerk_auth_enabled   — checked before attempting JWT verification
#
# The auth.py implementation will read these flags from the DB via is_enabled()
# once the Clerk upgrade begins. No code changes are needed until Phase 2.
