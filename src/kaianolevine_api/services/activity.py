"""The running list — what changed, and what broke.

Everything this service does that is worth hearing about arrives in Discord
in one shape, from one place. Two producers feed it, and they no longer share
a channel: changes go to ``activity``, faults to ``errors`` alongside every
other broken thing in the fleet. The split is by what the reader is doing —
``activity`` is scrolled back through after the fact, ``errors`` is watched.

**Data changes.** A SQLAlchemy listener tallies every ORM insert, update
and delete that actually committed, and the middleware posts one message
per request summarising them. It is wired to the session rather than to
the routes on purpose: a route added later is covered without anyone
remembering to cover it, which is the only version of this that stays
true. A hand-maintained list of "routes that notify" decays, and its
cheapest failure mode is silence.

**Faults.** The same middleware reports every 5xx and every unhandled
exception, plus any 4xx returned to a machine caller. A human hitting a
guard is the guard working and is not news. A cog getting a 400 or a 403
is a broken contract between two things this ecosystem owns.

What this does not see, stated here rather than left to be discovered:
``session.execute(text(...))``, and anything writing through a connection
this service did not open. ORM-enabled Core ``insert()``, ``update()``
and ``delete()`` are seen, but their row counts are not — the event that
names the table fires before the statement runs — so they are counted as
statements and rendered as such. An exception raised after the response
has started — a lazily streamed body, e.g. ``GET /v1/resume`` pulling the
PDF from Drive — never reaches this middleware either: Starlette re-raises
it after ``dispatch_func`` has already returned, so the middleware takes
its success branch and the caller sees a truncated 200. Sentry's ASGI
integration does catch it; Discord cannot without wrapping every streaming
response body.

The one machine failure this cannot attribute is a credential that does
not verify: the 401 happens before the caller is identified. That case is
covered on the caller's side, not here.

Delivery is fire-and-forget. Nothing is retried and nothing here claims a
success it did not get; ``services.discord`` owns what happens to a
failed delivery. Durable delivery would mean an outbox row written inside
the change's own transaction and a drain to empty it — deferred, and the
thing that changes the decision is wanting to answer "what changed on
Tuesday" from the record rather than from the channel. Nothing derived
from row data reaches the channel. A fault message carries the
exception's type and a Sentry id and nothing else, because a DBAPI
error's string representation contains the statement and its bound
parameters, and this channel is a chat room.
