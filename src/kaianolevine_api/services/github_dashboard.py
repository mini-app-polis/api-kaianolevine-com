"""GitHub repo status for the public dashboard — the one place GitHub is read.

**Why a proxy and not a browser fetch.** The page is static HTML on
Cloudflare Pages. A browser calling GitHub directly would either need an
unauthenticated 60-requests-per-hour budget shared by every visitor, or a
token shipped in the bundle. Reading GitHub here keeps the token on
Railway and turns N visitors into one upstream call per TTL.

**Why GraphQL and not REST.** The board needs, per repo: the default
branch's head commit, that commit's check rollup, an open-PR count and an
open-issue count. In REST that is roughly four requests per repo — a
hundred-odd for a two-org fleet, every refresh. In GraphQL it is one
request per fifty repos. The rate limit stops being something to think
about, which is the point: a portfolio panel that burns a budget is a
liability, not a demonstration.

**Private repos are counted, never named.** ``private_repos: aggregate``
in ``config_data/github_dashboard.yaml`` is the default and the reason
this module shapes its output rather than forwarding GitHub's. A private
repo contributes to its org's counts and nothing else — no name, no URL,
no description, no branch, no titles. The redaction happens here, before
the payload exists, so no route, schema or template can leak what was
never assembled.

**Staleness is reported, not hidden.** When GitHub fails and a previous
snapshot is in hand, the snapshot is served with ``stale`` true and its
original ``fetched_at``. A board that silently shows five-hour-old builds
as current is worse than one that says how old it is. With no snapshot to
fall back on the error propagates and the panel hides itself.
