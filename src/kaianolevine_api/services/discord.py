"""Discord notification transport — the one place a Discord webhook is called.

Two shapes, one destination. GitHub's payloads go to the webhook's ``/github``
suffix, where Discord parses the event itself and renders the same embed it
would have rendered had GitHub posted to it directly. Everything else goes to
the bare webhook URL as an ordinary Discord message. The suffix is the whole
difference between the two and they are not interchangeable: a GitHub payload
posted to the bare URL is rejected, and a Discord message posted to ``/github``
is rejected the other way.

Delivery failures are logged and reported to Sentry, never raised. The caller
is either GitHub — which must not be handed a 5xx for a Discord outage, since
enough of those make GitHub disable the webhook — or one of the fleet's own
scripts, for which a dropped notification is not a failed job. Both want the
truth in Sentry and a 200 on the wire.
