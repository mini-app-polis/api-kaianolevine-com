"""Discord notification routes — one for GitHub, one for the fleet.

Two callers, two admission rules, one destination.

``POST /v1/webhooks/github`` is the org-level webhook for both GitHub orgs. It
is public in the sense that no bearer token reaches it, and gated instead by
the signature GitHub computes over the raw body with a shared secret — the
only credential GitHub can present. It exists because GitHub's webhooks filter
by event type and nothing else: "pushes to main", "new pull requests" and
"releases, but not edits to old ones" are all decisions that can only be made
after the payload arrives, and this is where they are made.

``POST /v1/notify`` is the fleet's own path for ad-hoc messages, and takes the
ordinary machine credential every other first-party route takes
(``notify.messages.send``). Nothing about it is GitHub-shaped.

Two delivery shapes, because Discord's GitHub endpoint is not universal.
``push``, ``pull_request``, ``issues`` and ``release`` are rendered by Discord
itself, so those payloads are forwarded byte-for-byte to the webhook's
``/github`` suffix and Discord draws its own embed. ``workflow_run`` is not:
Discord accepts it, answers 204 and posts nothing. That silence is
indistinguishable from success at every layer above it, which is why the
workflow embed is built here and posted to the bare webhook URL as an ordinary
message instead.

Both routes return promptly and neither retries. GitHub disables a webhook that
keeps receiving 5xx, so a Discord outage must not become one; see
``services.discord`` for where delivery failures go instead.

# once as the pull request closing, once as a push. Recognising it would mean
# calling GitHub back to ask whether these shas belong to a merged PR, which

# messages on a rebase merge is the cheaper wrong answer.
