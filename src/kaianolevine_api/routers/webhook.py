"""Prefect flow-state webhook — the backstop crash report.

Prefect Cloud calls this when a flow run enters a failing state. It used
to write a row to ``pipeline_evaluations``; it does not any more. A flow
that crashed was never graded against a revision of the standards
catalog, which is why those rows had to carry a null
``standards_version`` to stop Pipeline Health claiming they had been.
Run status is a notification. The evaluations table holds what the
evaluator produced and nothing else.

**Why this exists at all, given cogs report their own failures.**
``mini_app_polis.pipeline_status.make_failure_hook`` runs *inside the
cog process*. When that process is healthy enough to run its own hooks,
it reports first and better — it knows what the flow was doing. When it
is not — OOM-killed, SIGKILL'd mid-run, the container replaced under it
— the hook never fires and the only witness left is Prefect Cloud. This
route is that witness.

The overlap is deliberate. An ordinary ``Failed`` run may well produce
two messages, one from the cog and one from here. That is the cheaper
error: a crash nobody hears about is worse than a crash mentioned
twice, and the two are distinguishable by their ``source``. Narrow
``PREFECT_NOTIFY_STATES`` to ``["CRASHED"]`` if the duplicates get
tiring — the states that reach Discord are configuration, not code.

**Auth is optional, and off unless configured.** The caller is Prefect
Cloud posting flow states, and what a stranger could do with the URL is
bounded: the message is embeds-only, so nothing in it can mention anyone
(Discord does not fire mentions from embed content), the display name
comes from the flow map rather than the payload, and there is no write
and no read behind it. The worst case is noise in a channel.

Against that, a required header is a new way for *this* route to fail
silently — and it is the backstop, the thing that reports when a cog was
too dead to report itself. One Prefect automation missed when adding the
header and its callbacks 401 into the void, precisely when they matter.
A credential that can quietly disable the last witness costs more than
the nuisance it prevents.

So ``PREFECT_WEBHOOK_SECRET`` is honoured when set and skipped when not.
Setting it is a decision available later without a code change; leaving
it unset is the default and is not an oversight.
