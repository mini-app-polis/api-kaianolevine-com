"""Public repo status board — GET /v1/github/status.

Thin by design. Everything that decides *what* a stranger may read lives in
``services.github_dashboard`` and the YAML beside it; this module's whole
job is caching semantics on the wire and the two failure codes.

**No auth.** The response is the same for every caller and contains only
what the committed config permits on a public page. Putting a credential in
front of it would move the token from Railway into a static bundle, which is
the problem the route exists to avoid.

**Two distinct failures, deliberately.** No usable token is 501
``not_configured`` — the deployment is incomplete, and an empty board would
misread as a fleet with nothing in it. GitHub being unreachable with no
snapshot in hand is 502 ``upstream_error``. The site hides the panel on
either, but the distinction is what the logs need.
