# kaianolevine-api

FastAPI service powering api.kaianolevine.com — sets, tracks, catalog
reconciliation, pipeline evaluations, feature flags, stats, live plays,
contact form handling (Brevo + Turnstile), and resume PDF proxy
(Google Drive).

## API Reference

All versioned routes are mounted under `/v1`. Interactive OpenAPI
documentation is the source of truth for request and response shapes:

## Developer Setup

### Prerequisites

- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```
- PostgreSQL (or use the `DATABASE_URL` from Railway for a shared dev DB)

### First-time setup
```bash
# 1. Install all dependencies including dev extras
uv sync --all-extras

# 2. Install pre-commit hooks
uv run pre-commit install

# 3. Copy env file and fill in values
cp .env.example .env
```

### Run the server
```bash
uv run uvicorn src.kaianolevine_api.main:app --reload
```

API docs available at http://localhost:8000/docs

### Run tests
```bash
# All tests (uses SQLite in-memory — no DATABASE_URL needed)
uv run pytest

# With coverage detail
uv run pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing
```

### Lint, format, type check
```bash
uv run ruff check src/ tests/ --fix
uv run ruff format src/ tests/
uv run mypy src/
```

### Pre-commit (runs automatically on every commit)
```bash
# Run manually against all files
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

Hooks run on every `git commit`: ruff lint, ruff format, mock method checks, type annotation checks. If a hook fails the commit is blocked — ruff will auto-fix in place, then `git add .` and re-commit.

## CI/CD

Every push to `main` runs CI (lint + tests).
Railway auto-deploys on push to `main`.
Feature flags control activation without deployment.
Flags are managed via `PATCH /v1/flags/{name}`.

## Versioning

This repo uses semantic-release for automated versioning.
Versions are determined automatically from commit messages
on merge to main:

- feat: → minor version bump (0.3.1 → 0.4.0)
- fix: → patch version bump (0.3.1 → 0.3.2)
- feat!: or BREAKING CHANGE → major bump (0.3.1 → 1.0.0)
- chore/docs/refactor/test/ci → no version bump

Never manually edit the version in pyproject.toml.
Never manually edit CHANGELOG.md.
Both are managed automatically on merge to main.

### Production Flag Rollback

Use flags for safe rollout and fast rollback without redeploying:

- Enable one flag change at a time via `PATCH /v1/flags/{name}`.
- Verify health immediately after change (API status, error logs, and endpoint behavior).
- If regressions appear, rollback by patching the same flag back to `enabled: false` (or `true` for previously disabled flags).
- Prefer changing ingest-related flags during low-traffic windows and monitor pipeline runs for 5-10 minutes after each change.
- Record each production flag flip in deployment notes (flag name, old/new value, timestamp, operator).

## Deployment Target

Designed for Railway.

## Authentication and authorization

This service is a conformant enforcement point for the `identity`
contract. It binds four functions — verify, resolve, authorize,
emit_audit — once per request, in `src/kaianolevine_api/auth.py`. The
decision itself lives in `identity.policy`; what stays here is
configuration and the FastAPI adapters.

### Credentials

One `Authorization: Bearer <credential>` header carries either of two
credential types, routed structurally by dot count:

- **Clerk session JWTs** (people) — two dots. RS256, verified in process
  against the issuer's JWKS document. The `sub` claim is the principal
  subject.
- **Named machine keys** (cogs) — anything else. An opaque per-machine
  string, compared in constant time against the keys this service holds
  in its own environment. The matched key *names* the caller, so no
  machine name is ever asserted in a request. Verification is local:
  nothing leaves the process.

There is no fallback between the two paths. A credential that fails the
path it routed to is rejected, not retried against the other. Clerk M2M
opaque tokens and `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` were removed outright — see
ecosystem-standards ADR-008 and CD-019.

Required environment variables:

- `CLERK_ISSUER` and `CLERK_JWKS_URL` — or `CLERK_ISSUERS`, a JSON array
  of `{issuer, jwks_url}`, when more than one Clerk tenant is trusted.
- `<MACHINE_NAME>_API_KEY` — one per machine declared in
  `identity_registry.MACHINES` (`deejay-cog` → `DEEJAY_COG_API_KEY`).
  Doppler-managed. Key material is never stored in the database, hashed
  or otherwise; the principal store holds names and grants only.

Machine principals and their roles are declared in code and reconciled
into the store at boot. Adding a cog is a reviewed code change, not a
row inserted by hand.

### Route coverage

Every route is in exactly one of three states:

- **Scope-guarded** (52) — `Depends(require_scope("<domain>.<resource>.<action>"))`.
  Roles are named bundles of scopes; a suspended principal is denied
  before roles are consulted.
- **Authenticated-only** (3) — a verified credential, no scope. This is
  the whole list: `POST /v1/wcs/me` (where a person first becomes known,
  so it cannot require a principal in order to grant one), `GET /v1/wcs/me`
  (reads only the caller's own profile), and `GET /v1/identity/whoami`
  (reports what verify and resolve saw, and authorizes nothing).
- **Public** (23) — see below.

Every decision is audited, allow and deny alike, with the enforcement
point, principal, scope, outcome and reason.

### Public surface

Deliberately unauthenticated, per API-008 / DOC-011:

| Routes | Why |
|---|---|
| `GET /v1/sets`, `/v1/sets/{id}`, `/v1/sets/{id}/tracks`, `/v1/tracks`, `/v1/tracks/{id}`, `/v1/catalog`, `/v1/catalog/{id}` | Public catalog reads backing the website. |
| `GET /v1/stats/overview`, `/v1/stats/by-year`, `/v1/stats/top-artists`, `/v1/stats/top-tracks`, `/v1/spotify/playlists`, `/v1/live-plays/recent` | Public aggregate reads backing the website. |
| `GET /v1/evaluations`, `/v1/evaluations/summary`, `/v1/flags` | Pipeline Health and feature flags — read-only, no per-owner content. |
| `POST /v1/contact` | Contact form. CORS + Turnstile gated rather than credential gated. |
| `GET /v1/resume` | Public resume proxy. |
| `POST /v1/webhooks/github` | GitHub org webhook. Gated by `X-Hub-Signature-256` over the raw body — the only credential GitHub can present — not by a bearer token. |
| `POST /v1/prefect-webhook` | Prefect flow-state callbacks. Reviewed and accepted as unauthenticated; optional shared secret when `PREFECT_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set. |
| `GET /health`, `GET /version`, `GET /` | Platform endpoints. `/` redirects to `/docs`. |

Client parity is maintained with `mini_app_polis.api.KaianoApiClient`,
which derives the caller's own key variable from its machine name and
sets the same header this module reads. The two must change in the same
release (AUTH-002) — a mismatch 401s every cog at once.

## Observability

Three-layer observability, aligned with the ecosystem standard:

- **Sentry** — unhandled exceptions and FastAPI integration, initialized
  in `main.py` `lifespan` when `SENTRY_DSN_API` is set.
- **Structured logs** — emitted via the shared logger from
  `mini_app_polis.logger` (install name `common-python-utils`); consistent
  JSON format and emoji-prefixed lifecycle lines across the ecosystem.
- **Healthchecks.io** — external uptime probes hit `/health` (public
  liveness endpoint, no auth, no DB access).

### Notifications

Five producers reach Discord and `services.discord` is the only module
that calls it. GitHub payloads go to a webhook URL's `/github` suffix so
Discord renders its own embed from the bytes GitHub signed; everything
else goes to the bare URL as an ordinary message.

Messages are routed to one of four channels, chosen at the call site
because that is the last place that knows what a message means:

| Channel | What lands there |
|---|---|
| `errors` | failed CI on the default branch, every Prefect crash callback, this service's own 5xx and machine-facing 4xx, and a failed identity reconcile at boot |
| `activity` | the running list of committed data changes, from the request middleware |
| `runs` | cog run reports through `/v1/notify`, every severity |
| `default` | everything else — pushes, pull requests, issues, releases, green CI |

Each channel has its own webhook variable — `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL_DEFAULT`,
`DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL_ERRORS`, `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL_ACTIVITY`,
`DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL_RUNS` — and each falls back to `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`
when unset. Separate variables rather than one map so each rotates on its
own and reads at a glance in Doppler.

The fallback is the rollout strategy: channels are configured one at a
time, and a channel that exists in code but not yet in Discord delivers to
the original webhook instead of vanishing. The corollary is that an unset
variable is a silent no-op that looks exactly like an unsplit channel, so
every send logs `channel=` and the producer that chose it.

Cog crashes are the one case that reaches `errors` without the cog
choosing it. A cog's own reports all go to `runs` so that channel is a
complete record of the fleet's runs; the crash reaches `errors` through
Prefect's webhook instead. That is what the two overlapping crash reports
are now for, rather than being redundant.

The GitHub route exists because GitHub's webhooks filter by event type and
nothing else. "Pushes to main", "new pull requests" and "releases, but not
edits to old ones" are all decisions that can only be made after the
payload arrives, so they are made here. One org-level webhook per org
points at this route; the policy is one function per event type in
`routers.notifications`:

| Event | Forwarded when |
|---|---|
| `push` | ref is the repo's default branch, not a deletion, and the head commit is not a merge or squash commit |
| `pull_request` | action is `opened` or `closed` |
| `issues` | action is `opened` |
| `release` | action is `published` |
| `workflow_run` | run completed on the default branch — every conclusion, pass or fail; `failure`, `timed_out` and `action_required` route to `errors`, the rest to `default` |

Two delivery shapes, because Discord's GitHub endpoint is not universal.
`push`, `pull_request`, `issues` and `release` are forwarded byte-for-byte
to the webhook's `/github` suffix and Discord draws its own embed.
`workflow_run` is not: Discord accepts it, answers 204 and posts nothing,
a silence indistinguishable from success at every layer above it. That
embed is built in `build_workflow_message` and posted to the bare webhook
URL instead.

Everything dropped still answers 200 with the reason in the body — a drop
is a decision, not an error GitHub should retry, and the delivery log
reads better when the only red entries are real ones. A delivery Discord
rejected also answers 200: GitHub disables a webhook that collects enough
5xx, so failures go to Sentry instead of onto the wire.

Two known gaps, both deliberate. Workflow runs off the default branch are
dropped, so a pull request whose CI fails is silent until it merges. And
rebase-and-merge cannot be told apart from a direct push, so a rebase
merge is announced twice — once by the PR closing, once by the push.

`POST /v1/prefect-webhook` notifies the `errors` channel when Prefect
Cloud reports a flow run in a failing state, and writes no rows: a crashed
flow was never graded against the standards catalog. It exists even
though cogs report their own failures, because
`make_failure_hook` runs *inside the cog process* — when that process is
OOM-killed or SIGKILL'd the hook never fires and Prefect Cloud is the
only witness left. The overlap on ordinary failures is accepted: a crash
nobody hears about is worse than a crash mentioned twice, and the two
are told apart by `source`. `PREFECT_NOTIFY_STATES` narrows it.

That route stays public. What a stranger could do with the URL is
bounded — the message is embeds-only, so nothing in it can mention
anyone, the display name comes from the flow map rather than the
payload, and there is no read or write behind it. A required header
would meanwhile be a new way for the crash backstop to fail silently,
which costs more than the nuisance it prevents.
`PREFECT_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is honoured in `X-Prefect-Token` when set and
skipped when not, so turning it on later needs no code change.

`/v1/notify` posts to the `runs` channel and requires
`notify.messages.send`, carried by the `notifier` role. Every declared machine holds it: the scope posts a message and does
nothing else, and a cog that cannot report its own failure reports it
later than it should. `ops-notifier` exists for notifications that belong
to no cog — scripts, one-offs, GitHub Actions — so those never have to
borrow a cog's key.

`GITHUB_NOTIFY_EVENTS` is the outer gate — the event types this service
has a policy for at all — and defaults to the five in the table.
`check_run`, `check_suite` and `status` are absent on purpose: they
duplicate `workflow_run`, and Discord renders none of the three.
